# civic-reflexivity-engines
A research framework for AI-mediated governance systems that enable public learning and collective sensemaking. Civic Reflexivity Engines (CREs) make policy assumptions explicit, expose trade-offs, and foster structured citizen engagement rather than automating decisions—creating adaptive democracies that learn in public.
